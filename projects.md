A selected list of projects that I have developed:

## 1. Beautify Me
 - Designed the concept of a beauty profile of a user that gathers their social and health related data by aggregating user profiles across multiple channels in order to ensure highly personalized beauty recommendations. 
- Fully Integrated with Google Health API and Facebook Graph API.
---

## 2. Political Stance Detection using Deep Learning
- Explored several architectures including a word2vec model, Google's pre-trained word embeddings and a LSTM based Autoencoder to detect a user's political orientation in the Indian political scenario.
---

## 3. Move-R: Movie Recommender system using Collaborative Filtering
- Developed a user-based movie recommender system by employing Pearsons Correlation Coefficient to estimate similarity amongst users in order to suggest movies to new users.

## 4. Analysing Tweets and Networks during times of "Political Sensitivity"
- Analyzed user tweets using numpy and pandas to draw inferences about different user group interactions. 
- Drew network graphs and studied centrality measures to understand network strengths and weaknesses.
