## Hi. Iâ€™m Zoya!
I'm an incoming Masters in Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa.  
I absolutely adore Python and I am currently fascinated by Neural Nets. My definition of chilling is reading a John Grisham on a nondescript, mundane weekend and yeah, sometimes binging TV-Series too! :P

Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn for any queries!

Thanks for stopping by, amigo! :D
