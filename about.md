## Hi. Iâ€™m Zoya!
I'm a Masters in Computer Sciene student at the University of Ottawa.  
I absolutely adore Python and am currently fascinated by Neural Nets. My definition of chilling is reading a John Grisham on a nondescript, mundane weekend and yeah, sometimes binging TV-Series too! :P


That's all for now!


Thanks for stopping by, amigo! :D
